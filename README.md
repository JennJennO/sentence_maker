# sentence_maker
This program takes in user input, applies grammatical corrections to that input, and outputs a concatenation of strings. Within the function two variables are used to identify strings as questions and to capitalize each string. Then a conditional is used to determine whether or not the string is a question. If the string is a question, that string is capitalized and inserted into an output that contains a questions mark (?). Otherwise, the string is returned as capitalized only. 

A new variable is created to encase the user input into a list format. Then a while loop is used to prompt the user to input a string. The function will continue to execute for each string the user inputs until the user enters "\end" into the program. Once triggered to terminate, the program will print all strings input by the user concatenated on one line.
